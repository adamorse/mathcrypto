# mathcrypto

A collection of functions designed for an introductory course in mathematical cryptography.

Note that the goal of these is not to provide the most efficient algorithms, but to provide
- workable code for short examples in an introductory course
- readable code for students who do not have much programming experience
- a basic introduction to using NumPy arrays and array-based arithmetic in mathematical/scientific coding

Currently available:
- conversion functions between lowercase English characters and the integers mod 26
- shift cipher
- affine cipher

Coming up:
- Vigenere encryption and decryption functions
- Vigenere ciphertext-only attack utilities
- Hall cipher
- Feistel systems
